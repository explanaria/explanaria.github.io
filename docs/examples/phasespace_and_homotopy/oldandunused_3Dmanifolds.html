			I've already shown you a lot of manifolds, but they've all had one thing in common: they're all 2D. One of the reasons manifolds are so interesting is that manifolds are a way mathematicians study things like four dimensions!

        Remember, for a 2D manifold, every point looks like flat 2D space if you zoom in far enough. In other words, an ant on the surface can move both forward/backward and left/right, and they wouldn't be able to tell the surface is curved - it would just look flat.

        Here's an example: the earth looks flat! If this sounds weird, remember that the earth is a manifold! It's actually curved, but we're so small that the world looks flat to us.

	<section id="label1" class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity:0">
        A 3D manifold is some type of space where every point looks like flat <u>3D</u> space!

            You can also get 3D manifolds by taking a continuous function involving four variables and setting it equal to zero. For example, x^2+y^2+z^2=5 is a sphere in 3D, so x^2+y^2+z^2+<b>w</b>^2=5 is a 4D sphere, whatever that means.

	<section id="label1" class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity:0">
        OK, but how do you make a manifold? In fact, you can build 2D manifolds yourself by patching together flat 2D pieces. In fact, sewing is literally making 2D manifolds out of flat pieces of fabric!

	<section id="label1" class="exp-label exp-slide" style="opacity:0">
        A 2D manifold is made out of sewing together squares... so a 3D manifold can be made by sewing together cubes!
