E = EllipticCurve([-36,0])
print(E)
print(E.torsion_points())
x = E.torsion_points()[3]

p = E.point([25/4, 35/8]) # the one corresponding to a 3-4-5 triangle
print[(n, n*x) for n in range(10)] # multiples
print(x + p) # x satisfies x+x=e, so (x+p) is interesting since (x+p)+x = p. can be used to talk about torsion points
