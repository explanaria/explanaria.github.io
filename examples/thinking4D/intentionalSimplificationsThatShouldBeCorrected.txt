In 3 circle, I say this is bad because 'useless coordinates' are bad. what I should really do is draw  a path of an airplane flying over the north pole, make graphs of r(t) and phi(t), show the discontinuity, complain about the discontinuity.



In bonus RP2, the entire horizontal axis of the red coordinate chart maps to the same point: north pole. this is because blue coordinate chart isn't actually right - blue coordinate chart right now is [lat, lon]. the entire top part of the blue coordinate chart maps to the same point: north pole.


but the entire horizontal axis of red chart also maps to north pole. that's NOT RIGHT. it should map to the 0* meridian.

I think I should take the BR and BL quarters of the red cordinate chart and swap them horizontally, and that would give the twist that the RP2 needs.

I need:
    - a version of 4 with a sphere  
    - something with multiple 3D coordinate charts
