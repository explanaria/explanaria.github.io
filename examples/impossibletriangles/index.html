        My goal with this presentation is to introduce you to elliptic curves, and why mathematicians care about them. To do that, I'm going to introduce the "Congruent number problem", a simple-sounding problem which leads us down a rabbit hole to a beautiful connection between triangles and points on curves with rational coordinates.

        Elliptic curves are the "next step up" from quadratic curves.

        Computer scientists are very interested in elliptic curves because they're currently the gold standard behind encryption - meaning nearly every single computer in the world has been programmed to do elliptic curve math in order to make sure you can securely send credit card numbers over the internet.

        But mathematicians are interested in specific things you can do with elliptic curves, and they might seem a bit arbitrary at first glance. In particular, they're very interested in a wonky way to "add" two points with rational coordinates on a specific curve and get a third, and this "addition" is usually defined without any context as to why this specific construction is useful. Why do we care about rational-number points and not all the other points?
