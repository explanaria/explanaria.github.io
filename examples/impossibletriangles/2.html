                Next, I want to tell you about a seemingly unrelated problem, which will lead us to an easier way to solve the congruent number problem.
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                Choose your favorite <kmath>N</kmath>, such as <kmath color="N">10</kmath>. Can you find three square numbers, such that the difference between each two neighboring square numbers is <kmath>N</kmath>?
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                <!-- Here's another way of visualizing the problem, geometrically. Can you find three squares such that the green area and the blue area are each N?-->
        
                Fibbonacci, the namesake of the Fibbonacci numbers, studied this problem. 
                As it turns out, if we can find three square numbers each <kmath>N</kmath> apart, it means <kmath>N</kmath> is a congruent number! Let's see why.

                Assume we already found these three square numbers. Then we can draw three squares - one with area <kmath>r</kmath>, one with area <kmath>s</kmath>, and one with area $t$.
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                If we remove the square representing <kmath>r</kmath>, the rest of the area is <kmath>2N</kmath> - the <kmath color="s">\text{green area}</kmath> is <kmath>N</kmath>, and the  <kmath color="t">\text{blue L-shaped area}</kmath> has area <kmath>N</kmath>, so combined their area is <kmath>2N</kmath>.
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                Now, we're going to cut this little rectangle...
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                ...and paste it on the side of this shape to make a rectangle. Since we haven't added or removed any area, this rectangle has the same area as the shape before: its area is <kmath>2N</kmath>.
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                Finally, drawing a diagonal across this rectangle splits it into two right triangles, with area <kmath>N</kmath>!

                <br>In other words - if we can solve the three successive squares problem for a certain <kmath>N</kmath>, this triangle shows <kmath>N</kmath> is a congruent number!
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                Just to check, we can also calculate the sides of this triangle - and if you do the math, because <kmath>r</kmath>, <kmath>s</kmath>, and <kmath>t</kmath> are square numbers, we're guaranteed that all the sides are rational numbers.
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                Great - so if we solve the three successive squares problem, we solve the congruent number problem.

                Let's start using some algebra to simplify the three successive squares problem!
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                It's a math fact that if you multiply square numbers together, you get another square number.

                <br>If we try to solve the three successive squares problem, we need to find three square numbers <kmath>r</kmath>, <kmath>s</kmath>, and <kmath>t</kmath>. Let's try multiplying <kmath>r</kmath>, <kmath>s</kmath>, and <kmath>t</kmath> together and seeing if we can simplify the equation.<br>
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                When we multiply together our three square numbers, <kmath>r</kmath>, <kmath>s</kmath>, and <kmath>t</kmath>, we'll get another square number, which I'll call <kmath>y^2</kmath>.
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">

                We can simplify this with some substitution. Our square numbers<kmath>r, s, t</kmath> are all related - once we choose <kmath>r=s+N</kmath> and <kmath>t=s+N</kmath>. 

                <br> To reduce the number of variables, let's get rid of <kmath>r</kmath> and <kmath>t</kmath> by writing them in terms of <kmath>s</kmath>: since all three square numbers are <kmath>N</kmath> away, we can substitute in <kmath>r = s-N</kmath> and <kmath>t = s+N</kmath>. Once we substitute into the equation and simplify, we get the equation <kmath>y^2 = x^3 - N^2 s</kmath>. Great - now we've reduced our problem to studying solutions of one equation!

                Finally, let's rename <kmath>s</kmath> to <kmath>x</kmath>, giving us the equation <kmath>y^2 = x^3 - N^2 x</kmath>. That's it for the algebra!
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                To recap: we've turned the problem of "is <kmath>N</kmath> a congruent number?" into "Does <kmath>y^2 = x^3 - N^2 x</kmath> have any rational solutions"? <!-- put more explanation in, i'm introducing rational solutions -->
                The equation <kmath>y^2 = x^3 - N^2 x</kmath> is an example of an "elliptic curve". Elliptic curves are very useful. But what we're interested in is solutions: every single pair of rational numbers <kmath>(x,y)</kmath> for which <kmath>y^2 = x^3 - N^2 x</kmath>.
