<h1>Spider-Math: Into the 2*3=8iverse</h1>

<p>Welcome to the 2*3=8niverse.</p>

<p>In our universe, multiplication only works in one way. 2*3 is always 6. But why 6 in particular? It's easy to write down other equations like 2+2=5 - they're just not true in the universe we normally work with.
</p>

<p>...but what about other universes? What if there was an ðŸŒŒalternate universeðŸŒŒ which followed all the same math rules, but where 2*3 was, say, 8 instead of 6? Will everything implode into a puff of contradictions? Or will it somehow stay internally consistent? Let's find out.</p>

<p>Below is an <b>alternate-universe multiplication table</b>, from an alternate universe where the rules of addition and multiplication work the same but 2*3 is 8 instead of 6. </p>

<p>In our universe, if you move sideways along a row of a multiplication table, you add the same number repeatedly. That's true because of the <u>distributive property</u> in our universe - so if the rules of this alternate universe are the same, we can still use the distributive property to move sideways across rows and up/down across columns.</p>

<p>Click the arrows to fill in the multiplication table, and you might find some interesting alternate-universe equations along the way.</p>
