            Andalusite and kyanite might look different, but they're actually made of the exact same atoms, in the exact same ratio: just aluminum, silicon, and oxygen. The difference is how they're arranged.

                    Geologists often name minerals after the places they were first discovered. andalusite got its name from a crystal which was thought to be from Andalusia, Spain... but the crystal was mislabeled, and was actually from Guadalajara, a completely different part of spain.

                The number of atoms won't help - both crystals have the same number (and ratio) of atoms, and there's billions of them.
                <br>Looking at one atom at a time won't help - each atom behaves similarly to all others. For example, in both crystals, every <span style={"color: " + getAtomColor('O')}>oxygen</span> atom has three bonds, and every <span style={"color: " + getAtomColor('Si')}>silicon</span> atom always connects to four other atoms.

                Group theory is a powerful way to think about repetition, symmetry, and the way things can combine and undo. In this presentation, we'll try to figure out the difference between andalusite and kyanite, and along the way we'll learn about group theory visually using these colorful graphs.

                When I first learned group theory, it was taught in a very self-contained way, and I had a hard time seeing why mathematicians want to use it everywhere. Sure, it was interesting to think about a way to define symmetry, but what kind of problems would lead someone to think about such specific actions?
                <!-->
                Group theory is usually said to be the right way to talk about symmetry. But another way to describe group theory is that it's all about things that can be combined and undoed. And there's lots of things in math which can be combined and undone, like adding numbers or applying rotations.

 It turns out that having a language to talk about repetition was the right way to talk about symmetry, so they could describe anything that could combine and undo. And because there's lots of things in math involving combining and undoing, the language of group theory snuck its way into 

        Whenever something in math involves combining and undoing, you can usually find mathematicians trying to analyze it using abstract algebra, creating new subfields of math named "algebraic X" in the process. There's algebraic geometry, algebraic number theory,
