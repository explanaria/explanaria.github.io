                The equation <kmath>y^2 = x^3 - N^2 x</kmath>, which we got from the three successive squares problem, is an elliptic curve!
                <br>Elliptic curves are different from ellipses. (They were first named "elliptic" because similar equations appear when trying to find the perimeter of an ellipse.)
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                An elliptic curve is the set of solutions to the equation <kmath>y^2 = x^3 + px + q</kmath>, for some <kmath>p</kmath> and <kmath>q</kmath>. Depending on the exact values of <kmath>p</kmath> and <kmath>q</kmath>, the graph of an elliptic curve might look like one smooth curve, or two distinct parts.

                <br>(Technical note: For our purposes <kmath>x, y, p, </kmath> and <kmath>q</kmath> are all real numbers.)
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                In our case, we get a different curve for each value of <kmath>N</kmath>. When <kmath color="N">N=6</kmath>, for example, we get the curve <kmath>y^2 = x^3 - 36 x</kmath>, which I've graphed here.

            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                Here's the key idea: every triangle with area <kmath color="N">6</kmath> corresponds to a point <kmath>(x,y)</kmath> on this curve.

            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                Here's how to convert from triangles to points on this curve. First, let's start with this rational triangle with area <kmath color="N">6</kmath>.
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                From this triangle, we can compute <kmath>r^2, s^2</kmath> and <kmath>t^2</kmath>.
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                During our algebra, we renamed <kmath>s^2</kmath> to <kmath>x</kmath>.
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                And finally, we can use that <kmath>x</kmath> to plot a point on this elliptic curve.

                <br>As long as the triangle has area <kmath>6</kmath>, we're guaranteed to get a point on this elliptic curve.
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">We can work backwards, too: if we find an <kmath>x</kmath>, we can compute <kmath>r^2, s^2, t^2</kmath>, which can be turned into a triangle with area <kmath>N</kmath>.  
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                But more importantly: if we can find a point <kmath>(x,y)</kmath> where both <kmath>x</kmath> and <kmath>y</kmath> are <u>rational</u>, we can construct a <u>rational</u> triangle with area <kmath color="N">6</kmath> - proving <kmath color="N">6</kmath> is a congruent number!
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                Therefore, we've turned the problem of "is <kmath>N</kmath> a congruent number?" into "Does the equation <kmath>y^2 = x^3 - N^2 x</kmath> have any pairs of rational numbers <kmath>(x,y)</kmath> which solve the equation?"
                <br>That's great for us - mathematicians have years of experience finding solutions to equations!
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                Another reason elliptic curves are useful is they have a special property: you can generate new solutions <kmath>(x,y)</kmath> from old ones!

                <br>For us, this means once we find one rational triangle with area <kmath>N</kmath>, we can use the elliptic curve to generate more rational triangles with area <kmath>N</kmath>!
