                The equation <kmath>y^2 = x^3 - N^2 x</kmath>, which we got from the three successive squares problem, is an elliptic curve!
                <br>(Elliptic curves are different from ellipses. They were first named "elliptic" because similar equations appear when trying to find the perimeter of an ellipse.)

                <br><a style="position:absolute;bottom:0.5em;left:0.5em;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;" href="2.html">Previous Chapter</a>
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                An elliptic curve is the set of solutions to the equation <kmath>y^2 = x^3 + px + q</kmath>, for some <kmath>p</kmath> and <kmath>q</kmath>. Depending on the exact values of <kmath>p</kmath> and <kmath>q</kmath>, the graph of an elliptic curve might look like one smooth curve, or two distinct parts.

                <br>(Technical note: For our purposes <kmath>x, y, p, </kmath> and <kmath>q</kmath> are all real numbers.)
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                In our case, we get a different curve for each value of <kmath>N</kmath>. When <kmath color="N">N=6</kmath>, for example, we get the curve <kmath>y^2 = x^3 - 36 x</kmath>, which I've graphed here.

            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                Here's the key idea: every triangle with area <kmath color="N">6</kmath> corresponds to a point <kmath>(x,y)</kmath> on this curve.

            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                Here's how to convert from triangles to points on this curve. First, let's start with this rational triangle with area <kmath color="N">6</kmath>.
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                From this triangle, we can compute <kmath>r^2, s^2</kmath> and <kmath>t^2</kmath>.
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                During our algebra, we renamed <kmath>s^2</kmath> to <kmath>x</kmath>.
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                And finally, we can use that <kmath>x</kmath> to plot a point on this elliptic curve.

                <br>As long as the triangle has area <kmath>6</kmath>, we're guaranteed to get a point on this elliptic curve.
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">We can work backwards, too: if we find an <kmath>x</kmath>, we can compute <kmath>r^2, s^2, t^2</kmath>, which can be turned into a triangle with area <kmath>N</kmath>.  

                <br><aside>(Technical note: if <kmath>x</kmath> isn't a square number, we need to use a different equation than <kmath>s^2 = x</kmath>; we can always turn rational points into rational triangles and vice versa, but other equations don't have the same nice geometric interpretations.)</aside>
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                But more importantly: if we can find a point <kmath>(x,y)</kmath> where both <kmath>x</kmath> and <kmath>y</kmath> are <u>rational</u>, we can construct a <u>rational</u> triangle with area <kmath color="N">6</kmath> - proving <kmath color="N">6</kmath> is a congruent number!
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                Therefore, we've turned the problem of "is <kmath>N</kmath> a congruent number?" into "Does the equation <kmath>y^2 = x^3 - N^2 x</kmath> have any pairs of rational numbers <kmath>(x,y)</kmath> which solve the equation?"
                <br>That's great for us - mathematicians have years of experience finding solutions to equations!
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                Another reason elliptic curves are useful is they have a special property: you can generate new solutions <kmath>(x,y)</kmath> from old ones!
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                Let's say we found two rational points on this curve. Elliptic curves allow you to define a way to "add" two rational points on the curve, and get another, different rational point on the curve!

                <br>For us, this means once we find one rational triangle with area <kmath>N</kmath>, we can use the elliptic curve to generate more rational triangles with area <kmath>N</kmath>!
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                Here's the recipe for computing a new point <kmath>P_1 + P_2</kmath>. The definition of elliptic curve addition is a bit technical, but this recipe is defined the way it is so that adding points works similarly to adding numbers.
                <ul>
                    <li>- First, draw a line through <kmath>P_1</kmath> and <kmath>P_2</kmath>. Because of how elliptic curves are defined, This line will always* intersect the curve in a third point.</li>
                    <li>- Then, reflect that point vertically over the <kmath>x</kmath>-axis.</li>
                    <li>- The resulting point is called <kmath>P_1 + P_2</kmath>, and it's guaranteed to be a point on the elliptic curve.</li>
                <ul>
                <aside>(* Technically, vertical lines don't intersect the curve in three points, but mathematicians use a tool called the "projective plane" to take care of those cases.)</aside>
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                What if <kmath>P_1</kmath> and <kmath>P_2</kmath> are the same point? Just like normal addition, adding the same point to itself is possible! Instead of drawing a line between two points, when adding <kmath>P_1 + P_1</kmath> you draw a tangent line to the curve. But everything still works out - we get a new point on the curve.
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">      
                As it turns out, this "addition" obeys many of the same rules as normal addition. In particular, if you add two rational <s>numbers</s> points, you get another rational <s>number</s> point.
                <br>That's good for us - remember, each rational point on this elliptic curve corresponds to a rational-sided triangle with area <kmath>N</kmath>!
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">      
                In other words, by using elliptic curve addition, once we find one rational triangle with area <kmath color="N">6</kmath>, we can construct a point on the elliptic curve, add it to itself, and generate new triangles with area <kmath color="N">6</kmath>!
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">      
                We might need to zoom out to see <kmath>P_1 + P_1</kmath>, but the math still checks out - <kmath>P_1 + P_1</kmath> is a rational point, which correspond to a valid rational triangle with area <kmath color="N">6</kmath>. And we can keep going - if we wanted to, now we could compute <kmath>(P_1 + P_1) + P_1</kmath> and find another rational triangle with area  <kmath color="N">6</kmath>.
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                By the way, modern encryption is built around adding points on elliptic curves!

                <br>Remember how I said your computer uses elliptic curves to encrypt its connection to the internet? In a nutshell, elliptic curve encryption weaponizes the fact that adding points on elliptic curves is really hard to undo. If someone adds a point <kmath>P</kmath> to itself repeatedly and hands you <kmath>P + P + \ldots + P</kmath>, it's almost impossible to find <kmath>P</kmath>, the point they started with. Elliptic curve encryption turns "undoing addition is hard" into "decrypting a message is hard"!
            </div>

            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                Finally, let me tell you about the solution to the congruent number problem! In 1983, a mathematician named J. B. Tunnell used deep properties of the elliptic curve <kmath>y^2 = x^3 - N^2 x</kmath> to solve the congruent number problem. His answer was a bit technical, so don't panic.
            </div>
    

            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                Here's Tunnell's answer: To figure out if <kmath color="N">N</kmath> is a congruent number, count the number of integer solutions to these two equations and compare them.
                <br>
                <aside>Counting these solutions is simpler than it sounds - a computer can just try every single possible combination of <kmath>x,y,z \leq \sqrt{N}</kmath>. There's not a lot of possibilities!</aside>
            </div>


            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                What a complicated criterion. What do solutions of these equations have to do with whether or not N is a congruent number?
            </div>


            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                Here's why it works: Tunnell showed that if his criterion is invalid, it means the elliptic curve <kmath>y^2 = x^3 - N^2 x</kmath> has no rational solutions. And as we've seen, no rational solutions on the elliptic curve means no rational triangles with area <kmath>N</kmath>.

                <br>By the way, we started with a geometry question about triangles, and now we're answering it using number theory. Isn't that interesting? Mathematicians love elliptic curves because they connect to so many different areas of math.
            </div>



            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                For example, let's do the math and figure out whether <kmath color="N">N=5</kmath> is a congruent number.
                <br>Looking at the second equation, <kmath>x^2+4y^2+32z^2=2.5</kmath>, we can see there's no solutions: <kmath>x^2, 4y^2</kmath> and <kmath>32z^2</kmath> are all integers, so there's no way they can add up to a non-integer like <kmath>2.5</kmath>.

                <br>Similarly, for the first equation, it turns out <kmath>x,y,</kmath> and <kmath>z</kmath> can't be bigger than 2, or else <kmath>x^2 + 2y^2 + 8z^2 \gt</kmath><kmath color="N">5</kmath>. So we can check every single possibility by hand and find none of them solve the equation.
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                So there are <kmath color="r">0</kmath> triplets of integers <kmath>(x,y,z)</kmath> which solve <kmath>x^2+2y^2+8z^2=5</kmath>,<br> and <kmath color="s">0</kmath> triplets of integers <kmath>(x,y,z)</kmath> which solve <kmath>x^2+2y^2+32z^2=\frac{5}{2}</kmath>.
    
                <br> Since <kmath color="r">0</kmath> <kmath>= 2 \cdot</kmath><kmath color="s">0</kmath>, Tunnell's criterion says <kmath color="N">5</kmath> <b>is</b> a congruent number!
            </div>


            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                That's it! I hope this gave you a taste of why mathematicians care about elliptic curves. Thanks so much for reading!
