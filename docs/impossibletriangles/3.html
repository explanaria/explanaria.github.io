                The equation <kmath>y^2 = x^3 - N^2 x</kmath>, which we got from the three successive squares problem, is an elliptic curve!
                <br>(Elliptic curves are different from ellipses. They were first named "elliptic" because similar equations appear when trying to find the perimeter of an ellipse.)

            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                An elliptic curve is the set of solutions to the equation <kmath>y^2 = x^3 + px + q</kmath>, for some choice of <kmath>p</kmath> and <kmath>q</kmath>. Depending on the exact values of <kmath>p</kmath> and <kmath>q</kmath>, the graph of an elliptic curve might look like one smooth curve, or two distinct parts.

                <br><aside>(Technical note: For our purposes <kmath>x, y, p, </kmath> and <kmath>q</kmath> are all real numbers.)</aside>
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                In our case, we're interested in the equation <kmath>y^2 = x^3 - N^2 x</kmath>, which gives us a different curve for each value of <kmath>N</kmath>. When <kmath color="N">N=6</kmath>, for example, we get the curve <kmath>y^2 = x^3 - 36 x</kmath>, which I've graphed here.

            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                Here's the key idea: every triangle with area <kmath color="N">6</kmath> corresponds to a point <kmath>(x,y)</kmath> on this curve.
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                Here's how to convert triangles into points on this curve. First, let's start with this rational triangle with area <kmath color="N">6</kmath>.
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                From this triangle, we can compute the areas of the three squares we saw in the previous chapter, <kmath>r^2, s^2</kmath> and <kmath>t^2</kmath>.
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                During our algebra, we renamed <kmath>s^2</kmath> to <kmath>x</kmath>.
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                And finally, we can use that <kmath>x</kmath> to plot a point on this elliptic curve.

                <br>As long as the triangle we started with has area <kmath color="N">6</kmath>, this process is guaranteed to result in a point on this elliptic curve.
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">We can work backwards, too: if we find an <kmath>x</kmath>, we can compute <kmath>r^2, s^2, t^2</kmath>, which can be turned into a triangle with area <kmath>N</kmath>.  

                <br><aside>(Technical note: if <kmath>x</kmath> isn't a square number, we need to use a different equation than <kmath>s^2 = x</kmath>; we can always turn rational points into rational triangles and vice versa, but other equations don't have the same nice geometric interpretations.)</aside>
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                But more importantly: if we can find a point <kmath>(x,y)</kmath> where both <kmath>x</kmath> and <kmath>y</kmath> are <u>rational</u>, we can construct a <u>rational</u> triangle with area <kmath color="N">6</kmath> - proving <kmath color="N">6</kmath> is a congruent number!
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                Therefore, we've turned the problem of "is <kmath>N</kmath> a congruent number?" into "Does the equation <kmath>y^2 = x^3 - N^2 x</kmath> have any pairs of rational numbers <kmath>(x,y)</kmath> which solve the equation?"
                <br>That's great for us - mathematicians have years of experience finding solutions to equations!
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                Another reason elliptic curves are useful is they have a special property: you can generate new solutions <kmath>(x,y)</kmath> from old ones!
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                Let's say we found two rational points on this curve. Elliptic curves allow you to define a way to "add" two rational points on the curve, and get another, different rational point on the curve!

                <br>For us, this means once we find one rational triangle with area <kmath>N</kmath>, we can use the elliptic curve to generate more rational triangles with area <kmath>N</kmath>!
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                Here's the recipe for "adding" two points <kmath>P_1</kmath> and <kmath>P_2</kmath> on an elliptic curve:
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Step 1: First, draw a line through <kmath>P_1</kmath> and <kmath>P_2</kmath>. Because of how elliptic curves are defined, This line will always* intersect the curve in a third point.</li>
                <ul>
                <aside>(* Technically, vertical lines don't intersect the curve in three points, but mathematicians use a tool called the "projective plane" to take care of those cases.)</aside>
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                Here's the recipe for "adding" two points <kmath>P_1</kmath> and <kmath>P_2</kmath> on an elliptic curve, continued:
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Step 2: Reflect the point from Step 1 vertically over the <kmath>x</kmath>-axis.</li>
                    <li>Step 3: You're done! The result of this "addition" is usually written <kmath>P_1 + P_2</kmath>, where the symbol <kmath>+</kmath> means elliptic curve addition, not your everyday addition.
                <ul>
                <aside>(Technical note: Why do we need the reflection in Step 2? As it turns out, adding points on elliptic curves shares many properties with adding numbers, including the associative law, <kmath>(x + y) + z = x + (y + z)</kmath>. This law says we can ignore parentheses and evaluate terms in whatever order we like, which is very convenient. Without Step 2, we lose associativity and more.)</aside>
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                What if <kmath>P_1</kmath> and <kmath>P_2</kmath> are the same point? No problem! Step 1 is slightly different when adding <kmath>P_1 + P_1</kmath>: the line you draw is the tangent line to the curve. But everything still works out - we get a new point on the curve.
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">      
                Elliptic curve addition obeys many of the same rules as normal addition. In particular, if you add two rational <span style="text-decoration: line-through">numbers</span> points, you get another rational <span style="text-decoration: line-through">number</span> point.
                <br>That's good for us - remember, each rational point on this elliptic curve corresponds to a rational-sided triangle with area <kmath>N</kmath>!
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">      
                In other words, by using elliptic curve addition, once we find one rational triangle with area <kmath color="N">6</kmath>, we can generate new triangles with area <kmath color="N">6</kmath>! Here's how: first, find the point <kmath>P_1</kmath> on an elliptic curve which corresponds to your triangle. Then, use elliptic curve addition to compute <kmath>P_1 + P_1</kmath>, and that point's corresponding triangle will be a new rational triangle with area <kmath color="N">6</kmath>!
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">      
                Let's find <kmath>P_1 + P_1</kmath> by following the same elliptic curve addition recipe. The math guarantees <kmath>P_1 + P_1</kmath> is point on the elliptic curve, but we might need to zoom out a bit to see it.
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">     
                Those are some big coordinates. But what matters is that <kmath>P_1 + P_1</kmath>'s coordinates are big <b>rational</b> numbers, meaning we can turn this point into a new valid rational triangle with area <kmath color="N">6</kmath>! 
                <br>It would have taken a long time to find this skinny triangle by brute force. Elliptic curve addition is powerful.
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">      
                We can keep going! We can compute <kmath>P_1 + P_1 + P_1</kmath> by adding <kmath>P_1</kmath> to <kmath>(P_1 + P_1)</kmath>. Following the recipe, we draw the line between <kmath>(P_1 + P_1)</kmath> and <kmath>P_1</kmath>, flip the point over the y-axis, and find a third point. This point gives us yet another rational triangle with area <kmath color="N">6</kmath>!

            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                By the way, modern encryption is built around adding points on elliptic curves!

                <br>Remember how I said your computer uses elliptic curves to encrypt its connection to the internet? In a nutshell, elliptic curve encryption weaponizes the fact that adding points on elliptic curves is really hard to undo. If someone adds a point <kmath>P</kmath> to itself repeatedly and hands you <kmath>P + P + \ldots + P</kmath>, it's almost impossible to find <kmath>P</kmath>, the point they started with. Elliptic curve encryption turns "undoing addition is hard" into "decrypting a message is hard"!
            </div>

            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                We've now seen <kmath>P_1</kmath>, <kmath>(P_1 + P_1)</kmath>, and <kmath>(P_1 + P_1 + P_1)</kmath>, and they're all different rational points. It seems like each time we add <kmath>P_1</kmath> to itself some number of times, we get a new point. 

                <br>If we keep adding <kmath>P_1</kmath> to itself forever, will we create infinitely many rational points? Or will we eventually run out of new points and start visiting points we've already been to?

                <br>It's an interesting question. If the answer is "yes" and we generate infinitely many rational points, it'll prove there are infinitely many triangles with area <kmath>N</kmath>.
            </div>

            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                As it turns out, "Are there infinitely many rational points?" is a very interesting question. In fact, there's an unsolved problem about elliptic curves, called the BSD Conjecture, which is related to this exact question - and there's a million-dollar prize for the first person to prove it.

            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                The Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture, or BSD Conjecture, is a deep unsolved conjecture about elliptic curves. If it's true (which seems very likely), it would create an incredibly deep connection between abstract algebra, number theory, complex analysis, and other branches of math.

                The details are very technical, but I'll try to give a quick summary.

                Here's a very quick summary of the BSD conjecture. The BSD conjecture connects many different ways to study elliptic curves in the form of two numbers. One approach is the one we took: studying rational points on the elliptic curve, and using elliptic curve addition to generate more. Using this point-adding approach, you can define a number called the "algebraic rank" of an elliptic curve which measures whether or not the number of rational points is infinite.

                <br>But it's also possible to study elliptic curves using other fields of math, such as complex analysis and studying infinite series. By using tools from those fields to study elliptic curves, you can define a second number called the "analytic rank" of an elliptic curve.

            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                The BSD conjecture says that these two ways to measure the rank of a curve - one which comes from the elliptic curve addition we've been working with this entire time, and one which comes from completely different mathematical fields - are measuring the same thing. And that, I think, is pretty beautiful.

                Finally, let me tell you about the solution to the congruent number problem!
            </div>
 
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                In 1983, a mathematician named J. B. Tunnell used deep properties of the elliptic curve <kmath>y^2 = x^3 - N^2 x</kmath> to solve the congruent number problem. It's not the neatest answer, but it still is an answer.
            </div>
    

            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                Here's Tunnell's answer: To figure out if <kmath color="N">N</kmath> is a congruent number, count the number of integer solutions to these two equations and compare them.
                <br>
                <aside>Counting these solutions is simpler than it sounds - a computer can just try every single possible combination of <kmath>x,y,z \leq \sqrt{N}</kmath>. There's not a lot of possibilities!</aside>
            </div>


            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                What a complicated criterion. What do solutions of these equations have to do with whether or not N is a congruent number?
            </div>


            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                Here's why it works: Tunnell showed that if his criterion is invalid, it means the elliptic curve <kmath>y^2 = x^3 - N^2 x</kmath> has no rational solutions. And as we've seen, no rational solutions on the elliptic curve means no rational triangles with area <kmath>N</kmath>.

                <br>By the way, we started with a geometry question about triangles, and now we're answering it using number theory. Isn't that interesting? Mathematicians love elliptic curves because they connect to so many different areas of math.
            </div>

            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
               Is that where the story of congruent numbers ends? Almost. There's one tiny piece left in the puzzle. One tiny, million-dollar piece.
            </div>

            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
               That's right - it's our friend the BSD conjecture. Tunnell's theorem solves the congruent number problem... assuming the BSD conjecture. The proof of Tunnell's theorem uses techniques which are only valid if the BSD conjecture is true. And nobody has proved the BSD conjecture yet.

            <br>There's lots of evidence the BSD conjecture is true. But until someone proves the BSD conjecture and collects that million-dollar prize, there's always the possibility his proof will come crashing down.
            </div>

            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
               What a journey. We started with such a simple question: are there any triangles with rational sides and area <kmath color="N">30</kmath>? It took us to the three successive squares problem, and then to elliptic curves. There, we found out how a weird way to "add" points on elliptic curves lets us create new triangles with area <kmath color="N">30</kmath> out of old ones, and discovered at the heart of our problem lay a million-dollar unsolved conjecture called the BSD conjecture.

            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                Elliptic curves still have many secrets yet to be decoded, and I hope this gave you a taste of why mathematicians care about them so much.

                For example, let's do the math and figure out whether <kmath color="N">N=5</kmath> is a congruent number.
                <br>Looking at the second equation, <kmath>x^2+4y^2+32z^2=2.5</kmath>, we can see there's no solutions: <kmath>x^2, 4y^2</kmath> and <kmath>32z^2</kmath> are all integers, so there's no way they can add up to a non-integer like <kmath>2.5</kmath>.

                <br>Similarly, for the first equation, it turns out <kmath>x,y,</kmath> and <kmath>z</kmath> can't be bigger than 2, or else <kmath>x^2 + 2y^2 + 8z^2 \gt</kmath><kmath color="N">5</kmath>. So we can check every single possibility by hand and find none of them solve the equation.
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                So there are <kmath color="r">0</kmath> triplets of integers <kmath>(x,y,z)</kmath> which solve <kmath>x^2+2y^2+8z^2=5</kmath>,<br> and <kmath color="s">0</kmath> triplets of integers <kmath>(x,y,z)</kmath> which solve <kmath>x^2+2y^2+32z^2=\frac{5}{2}</kmath>.
    
                <br> Since <kmath color="r">0</kmath> <kmath>= 2 \cdot</kmath><kmath color="s">0</kmath>, Tunnell's criterion says <kmath color="N">5</kmath> <b>is</b> a congruent number!
