                <br>This problem is called the "congruent number problem". Sounds simple, right? But as it turns out, solving this problem leads to some very interesting areas of math. In particular, the congruent number problem has tons of interesting connections to number theory and these things called <b>elliptic curves</b>, which are one of applied math's biggest success stories.
            </div>

            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                One of the most common questions people ask about math is "Does this have any real-world applications?". For elliptic curves, the answer is "absolutely". Every time you connect to the internet, your computer uses elliptic curves to encrypt your connection so hackers can't steal your credit card numbers when you shop online. 

                <br>Non-applied mathematicians also care a lot about elliptic curves because they connect many different subfields of math, such as number theory, geometry, and abstract algebra. In fact, they're so important that there's a <b>million-dollar prize</b> offered by the Clay Mathematics Institute for solving an unsolved problem about elliptic curves called the BSD conjecture. To mathematicians, elliptic curves are serious business.

                <br>This presentation is an introduction to elliptic curves and how they solve the congruent number problem. First we'll introduce the congruent number problem, then reframe the problem in a beautifully geometric way that's easier to solve, and finally discover how elliptic curves let us generate new triangles from old ones. Let's dive right in!
            </div>


            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                First, let's take a look at the congruent number problem: For a given number <kmath color="N">N</kmath>, can you find a right triangle with area <kmath color="N">N</kmath> whose side lengths are all <span class="rationalnumber">rational</span> numbers?

                <br>Let's start with <kmath color="N">N=30</kmath>, which is a particularly easy example. Our goal: find a right triangle with area <kmath color="N">30</kmath> whose side lengths are all <span class="rationalnumber">rational</span> numbers.

                <br><aside>(As a reminder, a <span class="rationalnumber">rational</span> number is a number like <kmath color="rational">\frac{1}{2}, \frac{5}{8}, \frac{6}{1}</kmath> (also known as 6), or any number of the form <kmath>\frac{x}{y}</kmath> where <kmath>x</kmath> and <kmath>y</kmath> are integers.)</aside>
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                For example, here's a random triangle with area <kmath color="N">30</kmath>, where we've drawn the lengths of the triangle's three sides. We're looking for triangles where all the sides are <span class="rationalnumber">rational</span> numbers, so even though this triangle has area <kmath color="N">30</kmath>, it doesn't mean that <kmath color="N">30</kmath> is a congruent number: one side has length <kmath color="irrational">\sqrt{136}</kmath>, and <kmath color="irrational">\sqrt{136}</kmath> isn't a <span class="rationalnumber">rational</span> number.
            </div>

            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                In this other triangle, however, all three sides' lengths are <span class="rationalnumber">rational</span> numbers. We did it! Because all three sides of this triangle are <span class="rationalnumber">rational</span>, and it has area <kmath color="N">30</kmath>, this triangle proves <kmath color="N">30</kmath> is a congruent number.
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                What about other numbers? For example, is <kmath color="N">24</kmath> a congruent number? Drag the red circle to explore triangles, and see if you can find a right triangle with area <kmath color="N">24</kmath> whose sides are all <span class="rationalnumber">rational</span> numbers.
                <br>
                    <div class="has-text-centered">
                        <button onclick="twentyFourHint.getDeepestChildren().forEach(output => EXP.TransitionTo(output, {'opacity':1}, 500));" class="button">Click for a hint</button>
                    </div>
            </div>

            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                This triangle has area <kmath color="N">24</kmath>! Therefore, <kmath color="N">24</kmath> is a congruent number.
            </div>
            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                Alright, so we know <kmath color="N">30</kmath> and <kmath color="N">24</kmath> are congruent numbers. What about other numbers?
            </div>

            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                We can construct new congruent numbers out of old ones by scaling the sides up and down. For example, if we start with the 6-8-10 triangle with area <kmath color="N">24</kmath> we already found, and divide each side's length by <kmath>2</kmath>, we get another right triangle with all-<span class="rationalnumber">rational</span> sides. Since we scale the both the width and height by a factor of <kmath>1/2</kmath>, the area goes down by a factor of <kmath>(\frac{1}{2})^2 = \frac{1}{4}</kmath>, giving us a triangle with area <kmath>24 \cdot \frac{1}{4} =</kmath> <kmath color="N">6</kmath>. This triangle means <kmath color="N">6</kmath> is a congruent number.

                <br>
                <aside>(This scaling technique means if we know <kmath>x</kmath> is a congruent number, we can scale each side of a triangle with area <kmath>x</kmath> by <kmath>2</kmath> to prove <kmath>4x</kmath> is a congruent number, or scale by <kmath>3</kmath> to prove <kmath>9x</kmath> is a congruent number, and so on. In general, if we know <kmath>x</kmath> is a congruent number, we also know <kmath>x, 4x, 9x, \ldots n^2x</kmath> are all congruent numbers.)</aside>
            </div>

            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                What about the number after six, 7? Can you find a right triangle with area <kmath color="N">7</kmath> and <span class="rationalnumber">rational</span> sides?

                <br>Click the right arrow when you want a hint.
            </div>

            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                Turns out <kmath color="N">7</kmath> is a congruent number, but even for really small numbers it can become really hard to find right triangles. The simplest right triangle with area <kmath color="N">7</kmath> has sides <kmath color="rational">\frac{35}{12}, \frac{24}{5}, </kmath> and <kmath color="rational">\frac{337}{60}</kmath>. <kmath color="N">N=7</kmath> hasn't even reached double-digits, and these triangles are already involving fractions with numbers over a hundred!
            </div>

            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                Things get even more hairy for the next congruent number <kmath color="N">N=13</kmath> - it's not that much bigger than <kmath color="N">7</kmath>, but the simplest triangle with area <kmath color="N">13</kmath> has sides <kmath color="rational">\frac{780}{323}, \frac{323}{30}, </kmath> and - wait for it - <kmath color="rational">\frac{106921}{9690}</kmath>. Those may be huge numbers in the numerator and denominator, but they're still <span class="rationalnumber">rational</span>.
            </div>

            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                And what about <kmath color="N">16</kmath>? Is <kmath color="N">16</kmath> is a congruent number? Try for yourself - can you find a triangle with area <kmath color="N">16</kmath> and <span class="rationalnumber">rational</span> sides?

                <br>Click the right arrow when you want a hint.
            </div>

            <div class="exp-slide slideTextItem">
                Turns out: For n=<kmath color="N">16</kmath>, it's <b>impossible!</b> There are no right triangles whatsoever with <span class="rationalnumber">rational</span> sides with area <kmath color="N">16</kmath>.

                <br>But... how would you prove that it's impossible? Right triangles, <span class="rationalnumber">rational</span> sides, and area <kmath color="N">16</kmath> are all straightforward conditions. Don't take my word for it - how do you know there isn't some triangle out there with area <kmath color="N">16</kmath> whose sides are ridiculously complicated fractions? Hunting for triangles manually clearly won't be enough. Is there a systematic way to figure out whether or not <kmath>N</kmath> is a congruent number?

                <br> To find out, we'll need to reframe the question and take a look at some geometry.
